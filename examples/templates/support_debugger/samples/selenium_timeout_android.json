  "description": "Our Appium-based Selenium tests are consistently timing out on Android 13 devices (Samsung Galaxy S23) in BrowserStack App Automate. The same tests pass on Android 12 (Pixel 6) and all iOS devices.\n\nEnvironment:\n- Java 17\n- Appium Java Client 8.6.0\n- Selenium 4.14.1\n- Gradle 8.4\n- App: Android APK built with targetSdkVersion 34\n\nThe timeout occurs specifically during element interaction after the app launches. The app loads correctly (we can see it in the session video), but any call to `driver.findElement()` hangs for 60 seconds and then throws:\n```\norg.openqa.selenium.TimeoutException: Expected condition failed: waiting for visibility of element located by By.id: com.ourapp:id/login_button (tried for 60 seconds with 500 milliseconds interval)\n  at org.openqa.selenium.support.ui.WebDriverWait.timeoutException(WebDriverWait.java:95)\n```\n\nWe have set the following capabilities:\n```json\n{\n  \"appium:automationName\": \"UiAutomator2\",\n  \"appium:app\": \"bs://abc123hash\",\n  \"platformName\": \"android\",\n  \"appium:deviceName\": \"Samsung Galaxy S23\",\n  \"appium:platformVersion\": \"13.0\"\n}\n```\n\nThe session logs show that UiAutomator2 starts successfully but the accessibility snapshot is empty after app launch. We suspect this might be related to the Android 13 notification permission dialog blocking the app, but we are not sure how to dismiss it in App Automate."
