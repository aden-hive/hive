  "subject": "Pytest tests not showing on BrowserStack dashboard",
  "description": "We are running 19 Pytest tests using the BrowserStack SDK. The tests execute locally and all pass, but when run via `browserstack-sdk pytest`, the BrowserStack dashboard shows 0 tests reported. The WebDriver session appears to start but immediately fails during setup.\n\nEnvironment:\n- Python 3.11.6\n- Selenium 4.15.2\n- browserstack-sdk 1.2.3\n- pytest 7.4.3\n- OS: Ubuntu 22.04 (GitHub Actions runner)\n\nOur browserstack.yml has projectName and buildName configured. We also have `parallel: 5` set.\n\nThe error in our CI logs shows:\n```\nbrowserstack-sdk: Initializing session...\nERROR webdriver_init: Failed to create remote session\nValueError: Missing required key in config\npytest: collected 19 items\npytest: Aborting execution: session setup failed\n```\n\nWe tried removing the parallel config and running with a single worker but the same error occurs. We verified our BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY and BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME are set correctly in the environment.\n\nThis started happening after we upgraded from browserstack-sdk 1.1.0 to 1.2.3 last week."
