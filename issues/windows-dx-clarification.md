# Proposal: Improve Windows Developer Experience

## Summary
While setting up the Aden Hive repository on Windows, some setup steps and examples assume Linux/macOS tooling (e.g., `ls`, `sed`, shell scripts). This can slow down first-time contributors on Windows.

## Proposed Change
If the maintainers agree, I’d like to:
- Add Windows CMD / PowerShell equivalents where appropriate
- Clarify existing setup steps without changing runtime behavior
- Keep the scope documentation-only

## Why This Helps
- Improves onboarding for Windows developers
- Reduces friction for contributors using non-Unix environments
- Keeps Aden accessible to a broader developer base

This issue is meant to confirm alignment before starting any implementation work.
